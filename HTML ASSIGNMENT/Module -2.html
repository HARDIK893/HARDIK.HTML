Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
        <!----------Examples---------->
[1]Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
    
[2]Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.



[4] Canvas and SVG tags.

Ans.
(*) Canvas : The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.
The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw
the graphics.
Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

(*)SVG : SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics
The HTML <svg> element is a container for SVG graphics.
SVG has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and graphic images.

 1.Scalability:   SVG images can be scaled to any size without losing quality. This makes them suitable for a variety of applications, from small icons to large graphics.

 2.XML Format:    SVG files are written in XML (eXtensible Markup Language), a text-based format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. This makes SVG files easy to create, modify, and manipulate.
      
 3.Interactivity: SVG supports interactivity and animation. You can use JavaScript to add interactive elements to SVG graphics, making them dynamic and engaging.
      
 4.Accessibility: SVG supports accessibility features, making it possible to create graphics that are friendly to users with disabilities. This is particularly important for web design and other applications where accessibility is a priority.
      
 5. Text-Based:   Being text-based, SVG files can be compressed, making them smaller in file size. This can lead to faster loading times for web pages and reduced bandwidth usage.
      
 6.Wide Browser Support: Most modern web browsers support SVG, making it a popular choice for web design and development.
